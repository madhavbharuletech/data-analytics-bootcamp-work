# 📊 Python & Data Analysis


This folder contains my Python learning work completed during my data analytics bootcamp.
It documents my progression from core programming concepts to applying Python for data analysis.

The work demonstrates the full learning workflow — from understanding programming fundamentals
and solving logic problems to analysing datasets using Pandas and exporting results.
